# iSpyAndroidToolKit
Android Spy toolkit. Should work with some tinkering on AndroidX. This was a beta version and more robust than a similiar repo I have hosted. For educational use only.
With the Pegasus spying app making headlines, I figured I would share an app I built. This app was custom built around 2014ish, the Alpha version is posted here on my github.
This release was a beta version, and what was possible with it is frankly scary. You can record calls,record front and back video, control these features via sms, log SMS
comprehensive error handling for the CAmera so that user was never aware. The final production release was even more polished, but has been lost to time.
